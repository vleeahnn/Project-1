                    <p id="phistory"> 
                        According to legends, the Yellow Dragon already manifested hornless to Fuxi, emerging from the River Luo, and instructed him with the elements of writing. When he appeared before Fuxi, he filled a hole in the sky made by the monster Gonggong.<br>
                        <br>
                        The Yellow Emperor was said to have turned into the form of the Yellow Dragon at the end of his life to ascend to Heaven. Since the Chinese consider him to be their ancestor, they sometimes refer to themselves as "children of the dragon" (also see: Nine sons of the dragon). This legend also contributed towards the use of the Chinese dragon as a symbol of imperial power.<br>
                        <br>
                        The Chinese national flag from 1889–1912 is also called the Yellow Dragon Flag (黄龙旗; 黃龍旗; huánglóng qí)
